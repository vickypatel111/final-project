                  First off, all you need to do is download the free Apple iTunes program on your computer (or either PC or Mac). Select iTunes U on the toolbar across the top of the main page, and youâ€™re in. On the main page, you have the option of browsing selections by school, subject, most downloaded, or noteworthy courses. The content is then delivered directly to you, whether the course is a series of lectures, videos, PDFs, or an entire book. After downloading course content, you have complete control to process it however you wish. You can choose to learn at your own pace, and decide whether to use your computer, iPad, or iPod touch to take it all in.
