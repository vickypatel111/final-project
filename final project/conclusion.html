             <h1>Conclusion</h1>
             <b><p>
                 I am a huge proponent of iTunes U and everything it offers. I feel that the pros easily outweigh the cons for what most people would use it for, myself included. While it is not perfect, Apple has designed an easy to use, groundbreaking interface for people all over the world to experience higher learning at no charge. If you have yet to give it a trial run, definitely give it a shot. It is 100% free, so you have nothing to lose but a few minutes of your time. Who knows, maybe you will find a new passion in the process.
